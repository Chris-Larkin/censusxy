The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy and efficient access to the [US Census Bureau Batch Geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/addressbatch?form) in `R`. It was developed specifically with large datasets in mind.

## Installing censusxy

The package is soon to be on CRAN, but meanwhile, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/censusxy")
```

## Example Usage
```r
homicide_sf <- cxy_geocode(stl_homicides, id, street_address, city, state, postal_code, output = "sf")
```
```r
> library(mapview)
> mapview(homicide_sf)
```
```{r exampleMap1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/homicide_example.png")
```
