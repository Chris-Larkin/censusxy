The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy access to the [U.S. Census Bureau Geocoding Tools](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) in `R`. `censusxy` has also been developed specifically with large data sets in mind - only unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data set exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset into appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so that a single object is returned. There is also support for parallel processing on Non-Windows platforms.

## What's New in v1.0.1?
- Changes to the default geocoding options to mirror updates to the API for the 2020 Decennial Census

## Installing censusxy
The easiest way to get `censusxy` is to install it from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("censusxy")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/censusxy")
```
