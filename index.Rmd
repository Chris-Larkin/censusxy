The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy and efficient access to the [U.S. Census Bureau Batch Geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) in `R`. The package offers a batch solution for address geocoding (as opposed to packages like [`censusr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=censusr), which provide functionality for a single address at a time). `censusxy` has also been developed specifically with large data sets in mind - only unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data set exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset into appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so that a single object is returned.

## Quick Start
If the `sf` package is already installed, the easiest way to get `censusxy` is to install it from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("censusxy")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/censusxy")
```

Additional details, including some tips for installing `sf`, can be found in the [Get started article](articles/censusxy.html#installation).

## Resources
The main [Get started](articles/censusxy.html) article has:

  * some tips on installing `censusxy` and its dependencies,
  * an overview of the package's functionality,
  * and considerations for handling computer timeout.
