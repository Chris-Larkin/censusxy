The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy and efficient access to the [US Census Bureau Batch Geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/addressbatch?form) in `R`. It was developed specifically with large datasets in mind.


## Installing censusxy

The package is soon to be on CRAN, but meanwhile, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/censusxy")
```
