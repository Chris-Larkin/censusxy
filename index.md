The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy access to the [U.S. Census Bureau Geocoding Tools](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) in `R`. `censusxy` has also been developed specifically with large data sets in mind - only unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data set exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset into appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so that a single object is returned. There is also support for parallel processing of requests, which can significantly shorten the time it takes to batch geocode large numbers of addresses.

## What's New in v1.0.2.9000?
* `censusxy` now supports parallelization on Windows (macOS and Linux had support for this since `v1.0.0`), thanks to a PR from [Christopher Kenny](https://github.com/christopherkenny)
* `censusxy` is described in a 2021 paper in [*Transactions in GIS*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tgis.12741) - please cite the paper if you use `censusxy` in your work
* `R` version 3.4 is now the minimum version supported
* We've made some internal changes to ensure that API issues fail gracefully and to improve the documentation

## Installation
### Installing censusxy
The easiest way to get `censusxy` is to install it from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("censusxy")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/censusxy")
```

### Installing Suggested Dependencies
Since the package does not need `sf` for its basic functionality, it is a suggested dependency rather than a required one. However, many users will want to map these data as `sf` objects, and we therefore recommend users install `sf`. Windows and macOS users should be able to install `sf` without significant issues unless they are building from source. Linux users will need to install several open source spatial libraries to get `sf` itself up and running. 

The other suggested dependencies that users may want to consider installing have to do with parallel processing. As with `sf`, it is not necessary for users to take advantage of this functionality to use `censusxy`. If you do want make requests to the Census Bureau's API in parallel, you will need `doParallel` as well as `foreach`.

If you want to use these packages, you can either install them individually (faster) or install all of the suggested dependencies at once (slower, will also give you a number of other packages you may or may not want):

```r
## install sf and/or parallel packages
install.packages("sf")
install.packages(c("doParallel","foreach"))

## install all suggested dependencies
install.packages("censusxy", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Resources

The main [Get started](articles/censusxy.html) article has:

-   some tips on using `censusxy` in different workflows
-   an overview of the packageâ€™s functionality,
-   and considerations for handling computer timeout.

## Issues with Parallel Processing on macOS
Users on macOS should note that there have been [issues reported](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/censusxy/issues/42) with using the `parallel` argument on macOS v12.4. Users with this specific operating system version *may* experience the following error if `parallel` is greater than `1`:

```
The process has forked and you cannot use this CoreFoundation functionality safely. You MUST exec().

Error in parallel::mclapply(batches, batch_geocoder, return, timeout,  :

```

We will update the package documentation again if this issue persists beyond macOS v12.4 and/or the next release of `R` (which includes the `parallel` package). In our testing, we have noticed that this behavior occurs inconsistency, and we have been able to successfully execute our code after restarting our `R` session.
