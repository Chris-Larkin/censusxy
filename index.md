The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy access to the [U.S.
Census Bureau Geocoding
Tools](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/) in `R`. `censusxy`
has also been developed specifically with large data sets in mind - only
unique addresses are passed to the API for geocoding. If a data set
exceeds 1,000 unique addresses, it will be automatically subset into
appropriately sized API calls, geocoded, and then put back together so
that a single object is returned. There is also support for parallel
processing of requests, which can significantly shorten the time it
takes to batch geocode large numbers of addresses.

## What’s New in v1.0.2.9000?

-   `censusxy` now supports parallel processing on Windows (macOS and
    Linux had support for this since `v1.0.0`), thanks to a PR from
    [Christopher Kenny](https://github.com/christopherkenny)!

## Installing censusxy

The easiest way to get `censusxy` is to install it from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("censusxy")
```

Alternatively, the development version of `censusxy` can be accessed
from GitHub with `remotes`:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/censusxy")
```
