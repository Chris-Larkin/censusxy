## Overview

The `censusxy` package is designed to provide easy and efficient access to the [US Census Bureau Batch Geocoder](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/geographies/addressbatch?form) in `R`. It was developed specifically with large datasets in mind.
 
## Workflow

This package contains a single function, `cxy_geocode()`.



## Timeout

The timeout is for small batches, of 1000 only
Too long and computer may sleep
If a batch times out, the next one will be attempted.

## Parsing Addresses

`censusxy` requires addresses to be parsed into components, and often times data is not supplied in this format. The R package `postmastr` can be used to parse address data into these components.

## Responsible Use

The US Census Bureau makes their geocoding API available without any API key, and this package allows for virtually unlimited batch geocoding. Please use this function responsibly, as many others will need use of this API for their research and development.
